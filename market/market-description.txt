v7.0.0 Upgrade
Pozoqo Wallet v7.0 brings with it a completely redesigned experience that seeks to enhance ease of use in an intuitive and familiar way across all your devices. We reimagined our recovery phrase verification process to highlight the importance of safeguarding this information for later wallet recovery, and users can now decide when they want to take the time to write down their 12-word recovery phrase. We have also added shortcuts to the home screen for quicker access to commonly used features and our menu has been repositioned in the app and organized to help users configure their wallet faster and more efficiently. Users now have much broader control over their security settings and the ability to decide how frequently they have to enter their pin code.
